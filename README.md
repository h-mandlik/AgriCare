## üìå DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è

This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) and the data used is provided without any guarantees from the creator. It is not recommended for making real farming decisions. The creator will not be held responsible for any outcomes resulting from its use. However, this project demonstrates how ML/DL techniques can be leveraged for precision farming if scaled up with accurate and verified data.

---

## üåæ Motivation

- Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a country‚Äôs economic growth.
- In a country like India, a large portion of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood.
- With the advancement of technology, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are being increasingly applied in agriculture to help farmers improve yield and make informed decisions.
- This project aims to showcase how ML and DL can be integrated into agriculture through a web-based platform.

## üìå Project Overview

This website demonstrates three key agricultural applications powered by ML/DL:

### 1. üå± Crop Recommendation
- The user inputs **soil data** (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, pH, etc.).
- The application predicts the **most suitable crop** to grow based on the input data.

### 2. üåø Fertilizer Recommendation
- The user provides **soil data** and the **type of crop** being cultivated.
- The system analyzes the nutrient composition and suggests:
  - What nutrients are **lacking or in excess**.
  - **Fertilizer recommendations** to improve soil health.

### 3. üçÇ Plant Disease Prediction
- The user uploads an **image of a diseased plant leaf**.
- The model:
  - Predicts the **disease affecting the plant**.
  - Provides a **brief description** of the disease.
  - Suggests **remedies or treatment methods**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is a Proof of Concept (POC) project. The data used is not verified and should **not** be used for real-life farming decisions. The creator holds **no responsibility** for any outcomes resulting from the use of this application.

## üìä Data Sources

- [**Crop Recommendation Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset): Custom-built dataset tailored for predicting the best crop based on soil conditions.
- [**Fertilizer Suggestion Dataset**](https://github.com/Gladiator07/Harvestify/blob/master/Data-processed/fertilizer.csv): Custom-built dataset used to recommend suitable fertilizers based on soil nutrient levels and crop type.
- [**Disease Detection Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset): Used for training a model that identifies plant diseases from leaf images.

---

## üíª How to Use

### üå± Crop Recommendation System
- Input the **nutrient values** (N, P, K), **state**, and **city**.
- Note:
  - The N-P-K values should be provided as a **ratio**.
  - For accurate results, refer to soil testing reports or trusted agricultural resources.
  - When entering the city, prefer **major or commonly known city names**. Remote or less-known areas might not be supported by the weather API (used for temperature & humidity data).

### üåø Fertilizer Suggestion System
- Input:
  - **Soil nutrient content (N, P, K)**
  - **Crop name** (you intend to grow)
- Output:
  - The system will analyze if the soil has an **excess or deficiency** of specific nutrients.
  - Provides **fertilizer suggestions** to correct the imbalance.

### üçÇ Disease Detection System
- Upload a **leaf image** of the plant.
- The system will:
  - Predict the **crop type** and determine if the plant is **healthy or diseased**.
  - If diseased, it will:
    - Identify the **disease name**
    - Provide **background information**
    - Offer **suggestions for treatment and prevention**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently, the system supports a limited set of crops (listed in the app interface).
